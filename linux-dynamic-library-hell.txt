Linux dynamic library file names end in .so. followed by version numbers.  In 
the past the distributions had symbolic links with names that just ended in 
.so and pointed to one of the versions of the library.  Many programs used the 
non-versioned file name to dynamically load the library. This caused some 
issues when multiple versions of a library were installed and different 
programs used different versions. 

Free Pascal seems to continue to expect this old behavior.
An example would be the openssl library.
Linux dynamic libraries names changes from one distribution to another.

Here is an example where I 'fix' mysql and openssl for FPC on Ubuntu 20.04.
cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
ln -s libmysqlclient.so.21.1.25 libmysqlclient_r.so
ln -s libmysqlclient.so.21.1.25 libmysqlclient.so
ln -s libssl.so.1.1 libssl.so
ln -s libcrypto.so.1.1 libcrypto.so
