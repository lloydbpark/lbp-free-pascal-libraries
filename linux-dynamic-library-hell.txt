Linux dynamic library file names end in .so. followed by version numbers.  In 
the past the distributions had symbolic links with names that just ended in 
.so and pointed one of the versions of the library.  Many programs used the 
non-versioned file name to dynamically load the library. This caused some 
issues when multiple versions of a library were installed and different 
programs used different versions. 

Free Pascal seems to continue to expect this old behavior.
An example would be the openssl library.
